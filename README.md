# Alchemy-Data-Free-Adversarial-Training

This repo is the official Pytorch implementation for the paper Alchemy: Data-Free Adversarial Training.

_The current code is a temporary version. The complete and perfect code will be gradually modified and updated._

## Install

We suggest to install the dependencies using Anaconda or Miniconda.

```bash
conda env create -f requirements.yaml
```

## How to use Alchemy?
